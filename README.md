# Nicer User Connections
Adds a bit of a boom-shaka-laka to those user connections.

# Installation & Updating
Let's be real here, you want cooler connections, just admit it. For installation, go to **Themes -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/Nicer-User-Connections
```

Since Powercord's updater is currently broken, you have to update the theme manually. In order to do this, go to **Themes -> Nicer-User-Connections -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git pull
```
