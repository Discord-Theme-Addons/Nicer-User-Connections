# v1.2.6
Learnt something new: can have a variable in a mixin. I've changed it to where the mixins make use of this feature, which makes everything look a bit nicer.

# v1.2.5
Repo renmame as well as slight tweaks.

# v1.2.4
Some small yet kinda big changes.
- Redid the sorting for basically everything, usin' some mixins now to fuel my laziness.
- Redid README.md
- Added support for Vizality, BetterDiscord and Web.
- Added a changelog. (you're reading it right now!)
- Fixed the check mark becoming less visible as well.
